For my analysis assignment, I compare and contrast three of Ray Bradbury's short stories with 3 of his novels. Of his short stories, I chose A Sound of Thunder, The Veldt, and There Will Come Soft Rains. For his novels, I chose Fahrenheit 451, Death is a Lonely Business, and The Martian Chronicles. The reason I chose these is that I wanted to see if there was a strong similarity or difference between Ray Bradbury's writing styles in his novels versus his short stories. Most of these text files I found on Z-Library or copied from an existing PDF.

<h1>Novels</h1>
For his novels, I saw that the term "there was a" had been used many times throughout the three novels, as he uses it 98 times throughout the three. Out of 192,522 tokens, this accounts for .05% of the text's n-grams of 3.

Oftentimes, "long," "smell," "man," "sound," and "small" are used after this term. This seems to be a common way for Bradbury to help the readers visualize the scene he has written.
Another term used often is "the old man," used 84 times in the three novels, typically after a quote from a character. Similar to the last term, it also occurs .05% of the time.

Bradbury seems to have a common theme through these three novels, with all novels mentioning an old man. Possibly Bradbury sees an older character as symbolism, or maybe just enjoys writing about older men.
The long term "in the middle of the" is used 26 times throughout these three novels. Out of 192,516 tokens, this term is used .016% of the time for an N-Gram of 5.

The author has a tendency to use the same terms in order to describe something, as shown in the previous two terms.
Here are some of the common words from Ray Bradbury's novels:
<img class="img" src="textanalysis/screencaptures/novelwordclustergoodnew.jpg" alt="common words">
Throughout the three novels, the two most common words are "said" and "like." The word "said" is used 1,317 times and the word "like" is used 795 times. This means that out of the 188,051 words Bradbury uses in his novels, 1.12% of the words are either "said" or "like."
Here are distinct words from the novels:
<img class="img" src="textanalysis/screencaptures/noveldistinctwordsnew.jpg" alt="distinct words">
The distinct words in these novels seem to be either a place or thing, showing the different topics Bradbury writes about in his novels. It is safe to assume that the novel Death is a Lonely Business takes place in Venice with the main character often going to a pier, Fahrenheit 451 could be about a fireman that visits a parlour. The Martian Chronicles is harder to decifer, as the distict words shown are common words.
